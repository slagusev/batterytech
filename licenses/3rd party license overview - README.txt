For your convenience, BatteryTech includes several third party libraries in the source distribution.

These libraries have all been modified either to fit into a build or to work on platforms that they otherwise would not work on.
Different libraries may have different terms of licensing but all modified source code for all libraries are included and accompanying licenses are in this directory and plainly labeled for each.  

Only the Seymour Collada test object is under the SCEA Shared Source License and nothing else.

If you have any questions about licensing, please contact support@batterypoweredgames.com
